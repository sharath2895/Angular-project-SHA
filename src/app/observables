promise - 
observables - used when we have stream of data --> 

subscribe --> triggering the observables/promise or it will invoke the observables to emit the observed value
unscribe --> this unscribes the subscriber

ways to unscribe:

async pipe - best approach --> its an pure pipe , unscribes automatically when ever subscription happens
 --->  if the usage of data is only in templete level
first() -this allows subscription once --> onload
take(5) - allows subscription 5 times and unscribes
takewhile() - its an conditional suncriber, if condition true it will subscribe
takeuntill() - subscribes untill the condition satisifies --> if you want the observable to be active and the end of 
the subscription is not known,, and if the data usage is required in yout ts file you may need this operator



Observables --> subject
subject --> subject is an special type of observable, this is an example for cold observables
behaviourSubject --> it will start with an value, it will continuously emit value
asyncSubject -->it will continuously observe value and emits all when completed
ReplaySubject(5) --> this will save last 5 observed values and can be subscribed 


shareReply --> caching mechanism
